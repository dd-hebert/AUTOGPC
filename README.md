# AUTOGPC
A full GUI MATLAB app for processing GPC data files from Malvern OMNISEC software. 

This app parses and analyzes files exported directly from OMNISEC. The app will calculate polymer weight-average molecular weight (<i>M<sub>w</sub></i>), number-average molecular weight (<i>M<sub>n</sub></i>), polydispersity index (*ƒê*), and fractional monomer conversion (*p*). A report of the data can be generated along with images of the chromatograms for each detector.

## How to Use
Download all the repo files into your MATLAB working directory, then open and run the ``.m`` file. You can use the ``.mlapp`` file and MATLAB's App Designer to make changes to the app if you wish.

The text file ``polymers.txt`` provides a list of values for polymer-repeat-unit molecular weights (<i>M<sub>0</sub></i>). This list can be edited from within the app.

The text file ``default_calibration.txt`` gives the default calibration of the detectors. Recalibrating from within the app and saving the new calibration will overwrite the previous ``default_calibration.txt``.
